NowJS Version 0.2

Changes since version 0.1:
  * Unified nowLib.js was split into nowClientLib.js and nowServerLib.js
  * In nowServerLib.js, NowWatcher class was replaced with a Harmony Proxy implementation in proxy.js
  * nowClientLib.js continues to use NowWatcher class for namespace traversal.

Known Issues:
  * Server crashes with a "hasOwnProperty of undefined" error when a client abruptly connects.
  * Library does not expose client connect and disconnect events to the developer.
  * Library does not expose any form of unique client ID to the developer.
  * Library does not provide a way to select particular clients or a single client based on filters/criteria.
